> How to fix the buttons not responding issue on your Pebble Steel


## Problem description
Following info is thanks to user Denis_Amiton from [this Pebble Forums thread](https://forums.pebble.com/t/watch-buttons-not-working/19715/18)
> The problem is in the broken wire. All buttons have a common contact on the one side of the watch. And I think this contact is the ground contact of the buttons but not the watch.
> In normal state these contacts are connected with a right side of the watch (with the connector) and for example with a small circle on the right. But when the line is broken this buttons don’t work. when you press the down button the contact in the wire restored for a small time. But then it stops working again.
> For repairing you need the small wire and very thin soldering iron.
if you look at the picture you’ll see how to fix it.
> It’s a 100% solution.
> I’ve repaired my Pebble Steel and now it works fine.
